# VTuberDashboard

## Technologies

This project is a personal playground for learning new frameworks and concepts, in the context of a modern and flexible javascripts webapp. 

Used technologies so far: 

* Node - express.js
* Docker
* Swagger (Editor/UI/...)
* React 

## Motivation

I want to build a "dashboard" for watching and interacting with different VTuber (Hololive, Nijisanji, independent, ...) groups .
The focus of the dashboard is to display the current live VTuber, and their schedules streams.
